# Rustlings Solutions

My solutions for [rustlins](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) ðŸ¦€
* [Main branch](https://github.com/richard-kung/rustlings-solutions/tree/main) remains the same as the official rustlings branch.
* [**Solutions branch**](https://github.com/richard-kung/rustlings-solutions/tree/solutions) is the one contains the solutions. All exercises are finished.

My approaches are, instead of seeking best performance, trying to explore the standard library and make my code compact. It's fun. I hope you enjoy learning Rust as I do.
